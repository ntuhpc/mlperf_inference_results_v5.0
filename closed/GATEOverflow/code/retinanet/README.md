## 2D Object Detection using Retinanet

In this submission round GATEOverflow has used three implementations to run the MLPerf inference Retinanet model using the [MLCFlow automation](https://github.com/mlcommons/mlcflow).

1. MLCommons Reference implementation (onnxruntime and tensorflow)
2. MLCommons C++ implementation (onnxruntime)
3. Nvidia implementation (TensorRT)
 
Please see [MLPerf inference docs](https://docs.mlcommons.org/inference/benchmarks/object_detection/retinanet/) for the run commands to be followed.
